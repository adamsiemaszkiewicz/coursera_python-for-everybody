## Comments

This repo contains all my work for this specialization which consists of 5 courses. All the code base and images, are taken from [Applied Data Science with Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python).

*I took this course as a follow up to Andrew Ng's [Machine Learning Course](https://github.com/adamsiemaszkiewicz/coursera_machine-learning) to gain Python knowledge to be able to use it further down the machine learning road. I've completed the 5-course specialization within two weeks.*
